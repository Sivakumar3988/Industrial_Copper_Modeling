# Industrial_Copper_Modeling
**Industrial Copper Modeling Project**

This repository contains code and resources for the Industrial Copper Modeling project, which aims to develop machine learning models for predicting selling prices and classifying leads as either successful or unsuccessful in the copper industry.

**Project Overview**

The copper industry deals with sales and pricing data that may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data. Manual prediction methods can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions. To address these challenges, this project utilizes machine learning regression and classification models.

**Problem Statement**

The primary objectives of this project are:

Develop a machine learning regression model to predict selling prices based on various features.

Create a machine learning classification model to classify leads as either successful or unsuccessful.

Build a Streamlit web application for easy input and visualization of model predictions.

**Skills Learned**

The key skills learned from this project include:

Python scripting

Data preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Machine learning regression and classification

Streamlit web application development
